## Portfolio
- [PRP - C](#prp---c)
- [RPH - Python](#rph---python)
- [PJV - Java](#pjv---java)

### PRP - C
- Command Line Tools ~ utilities demonstrating C programming concepts:
  - Array and string manipulation (hw01, hw02)
  - File operations and parsing (hw03)
  - Data structures implementation (hw04, hw05)
  - Memory management (hw06)
- Graph Algorithms ~ implementations of fundamental graph operations and algorithms:
  - Graph representation and manipulation (hw07, hw08)
  - File I/O for both text and binary formats (hw09)
  - Memory management with dynamic allocation (hw09)
  - Implementations of various graph algorithms (hw10)
  - _Note: hw10 framework was provided, my contribution was integration of specific functions (pq_update, dijkstra.c, dijkstra_set_graph & dijkstra_get_solution, graph.c)_

### RPH - Python
- Spam Filter ~ a modular email classification system with various spam detection methods:
  - Multiple filter types (Naive, Paranoid, Random and advanced heuristic Filter)
  - Analyzes email headers, domains, subject keywords, text patterns and links
  - Uses confusion matrix for quality assessment
  - Training and testing on email corpus data
- Reversi ~ a player implementation for the Reversi board game:
  - Heuristic-based move selection
  - Position rating matrix
  - Valid move detection with weighted decision making
  - Complete game rules implementation

### PJV - Java
- Core Java Concepts - Standalone assignments demonstrating Java fundamentals:
  - Calculator (console-based arithmetic operations)
  - CircularArrayQueue (queue implementation with fixed capacity)
  - SequenceStats (statistical calculations on number sequences)
  - BruteForceAttacker (recursive password cracking implementation)
  - Tree & Node (binary tree with recursive traversal and string representation)
- [2D Game Engine](https://github.com/Petr-Chalupa/FEL) - Semester project implementing a custom game engine _**(LINK TO DO)**_
